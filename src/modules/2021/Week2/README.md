## Week description 🏁
<p>This week we will be covering six main technology roles, necessary skills, responsibilities, and tools that thoes roles typically use. After this we will be learning more about the fundamentals of programming and the tools that developers use, such as “Frameworks”, “Libraries” and “Runtime enviroments”, we will be answering questions such as:  What do these names mean? How are they used? What are they for?. Finally we will be talking about a fundamental part of every project, the "Data". How do developers handle the data? What are databases? All this and more, will be answered this week.</p>

## Week activities 🎉
* [Try JavaScript](https://jsbin.com/?js,console)
  ```
  We will be using JavaScript to create a program that adds two numbers and shows us the result, don't worry, first we will be looking at an example, and then together we will be building our program to add the numbers.
  ```
* [Framework, libraries and languages](https://app.mural.co/invitation/mural/bootcamp3167/1629066183970?sender=u7d13b3aa48fd45946b235761&key=54416e1c-6a71-40c1-a880-6a2993522c9d)
  ```
  Together we will be classifying different elements in the sections of “Framework”, “Librarie” or “Language”, with this we will finish learning the difference of each one of them.

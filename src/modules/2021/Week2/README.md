## Week activities 🎉
* [Try JavaScript](https://jsbin.com/?js,console)
  <p>We will be using JavaScript to create a program that adds two numbers and shows us the result, don't worry, first we will be looking at an example, and then together we will be building our program to add the numbers.</p>
  
* [Framework, libraries and languages](https://app.mural.co/invitation/mural/bootcamp3167/1629066183970?sender=u7d13b3aa48fd45946b235761&key=54416e1c-6a71-40c1-a880-6a2993522c9d)
  <p>Together we will be classifying different elements in the sections of “Framework”, “Librarie” or “Language”, with this we will finish learning the difference of each one of them.</p>
